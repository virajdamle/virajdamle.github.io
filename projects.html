Recently “lubricant-infused-slippery” surfaces have gained tremendous attraction due to their “slipperiness” and potential applications in wide range of applications such as condensation, bio-fouling, anti-icing surface, etc. Proposed applications for such surfaces vary from making catheter free from bacterial growth to making slippery coating on aircraft wing such that ice will not accumulate which may lead to aviation accident. However before such surfaces can be used at large-scale applications one needs to study the underlying physics of droplet lubricant interaction. Once the physical mechanism of such surfaces is well understood, efficient slippery surfaces can be fabricated. I investigated lubricant- droplet interaction during my summer internship at Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. Specifically I looked into how the droplet shape and associated surface tensions vary as lubricant from slippery surfaces evaporates.

               My graduate research at Arizona State University is focused on tuning surface wettability through bulk engineering. Surface wettability, in simplified terms, means how liquids interact with surfaces i.e. if liquid sticks to surface or slips off it under external force. Surface wettability has crucial role in variety of applications ranging from making fabric for a stain-free to improving the efficiency of power-plants. Surface texture and surface chemistry is tailored to achieve desired surface wettability. However there is inherent limitation to this approach. Surface texture or surface chemistry can be degraded by foreign source of chemical contamination or physical damage.

                Thus in my graduate research I am trying to fabricate a novel type of material which will have desired wetting properties at the exterior surface and it will be immune to contamination or physical damage. Thus it will be robust and durable which will enable it to be used in the “real-life setting”. I am looking into fundamental and applied aspects of two applications where this phenomenon is important: 1. increasing the rate of condensation heat transfer and 2.developing protective gears for healthcare and military applications.

               Global warming is one of the key issues posed to humanity today. Refrigeration is an important sector which has direct impact on global warming as many refrigerants have high global warming potential (GWP). To address the stringent fluorinated gas emission regulation put in effect by government agencies, new refrigerants are being developed. Many new household and industrial refrigeration equipments use these new “eco-friendly” refrigerants. However problem still persists with the old equipments which were originally designed to work with refrigerants with higher GWP. Hence it is important to see if the old refrigerant can be replaced by suitable new working fluid with lower GWP.

                For my Master's thesis at LSBU, I investigated the performance of commercial refrigeration unit when the working fluid (refrigerant) in the system was switched from original R404a to newly developed R407f. Latter refrigerant has lower global warming potential than the prior one. Thus using R407f in supermarket refrigerators across The UK has high potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hence I conducted these studies to check the feasibility of this possibility.

               Improving the energy efficiency of the power plants and waste-heat recovery systems are of profound importance due to their societal and monetary benefits. Organic Rankine Cycle is a promising candidate as far as the waste heat recovery techniques are concerned. Organic Rankine Cycle enables converting low grade, low temperature waste heat into useful electricity using refrigerants as working fluid in power plant instead of water which is a typical working fluid in steam power plant. It has been established that using mixture of multiple refrigerants in refrigeration system is beneficial. Hence the idea was to see if same is applicable in the case of Organic Rankine Cycles. Specifically, for my Masters thesis, my research focus was optimizing the composition of multi-fluid refrigerant mixture as a working fluid for organic Rankine cycle

               Typically refrigeration systems need electricity to operate. However there is another class of refrigeration system, known as vapor absorption refrigeration system, which operate on heat instead of electricity. This opens up lot of opportunities to take refrigeration to remote regions not connected to electric grid. Especially in rural India, there are many places which are not connected to electric grid till date. For my undergraduate thesis I looked into feasibility study and performance investigation of biogas powered vapor absorption refrigeration. Biogas can be made abundantly available in rural India which can form a heat source to run vapor absorption refrigerator. Such systems, if become commercially viable, can play a crucial role in improving health and economy in rural India. Specifically, storage of vaccines, dairy products etc will be possible with refrigerators and cold storages operating on vapor absorption refrigeration principle.
